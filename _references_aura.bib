	shorttitle = {Red Teaming Language Models to Reduce Harms},
	abstract = {We describe our early efforts to red team language models in order to simultaneously discover, measure, and attempt to reduce their potentially harmful outputs. We make three main contributions. First, we investigate scaling behaviors for red teaming across 3 model sizes (2.7B, 13B, and 52B parameters) and 4 model types: a plain language model ({LM}); an {LM} prompted to be helpful, honest, and harmless; an {LM} with rejection sampling; and a model trained to be helpful and harmless using reinforcement learning from human feedback ({RLHF}). We ﬁnd that the {RLHF} models are increasingly difﬁcult to red team as they scale, and we ﬁnd a ﬂat trend with scale for the other model types. Second, we release our dataset of 38,961 red team attacks for others to analyze and learn from. We provide our own analysis of the data and ﬁnd a variety of harmful outputs, which range from offensive language to more subtly harmful non-violent unethical outputs. Third, we exhaustively describe our instructions, processes, statistical methodologies, and uncertainty about red teaming. We hope that this transparency accelerates our ability to work together as a community in order to develop shared norms, practices, and technical standards for how to red team language models. Warning: this paper contains examples that may be offensive or upsetting.},

	abstract = {With the recent wave of progress in artificial intelligence ({AI}) has come a growing awareness of the large-scale impacts of {AI} systems, and recognition that existing regulations and norms in industry and academia are insufficient to ensure responsible {AI} development. In order for {AI} developers to earn trust from system users, customers, civil society, governments, and other stakeholders that they are building {AI} responsibly, they will need to make verifiable claims to which they can be held accountable. Those outside of a given organization also need effective means of scrutinizing such claims. This report suggests various steps that different stakeholders can take to improve the verifiability of claims made about {AI} systems and their associated development processes, with a focus on providing evidence about the safety, security, fairness, and privacy protection of {AI} systems. We analyze ten mechanisms for this purpose--spanning institutions, software, and hardware--and make recommendations aimed at implementing, exploring, or improving those mechanisms.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03286},
	abstract = {Language Models ({LMs}) often cannot be deployed because of their potential to harm users in hard-to-predict ways. Prior work identiﬁes harmful behaviors before deployment by using human annotators to hand-write test cases. However, human annotation is expensive, limiting the number and diversity of test cases. In this work, we automatically ﬁnd cases where a target {LM} behaves in a harmful way, by generating test cases (“red teaming”) using another {LM}. We evaluate the target {LM}’s replies to generated test questions using a classiﬁer trained to detect offensive content, uncovering tens of thousands of offensive replies in a 280B parameter {LM} chatbot. We explore several methods, from zero-shot generation to reinforcement learning, for generating test cases with varying levels of diversity and difﬁculty. Furthermore, we use prompt engineering to control {LM}-generated test cases to uncover a variety of other harms, automatically ﬁnding groups of people that the chatbot discusses in offensive ways, personal and hospital phone numbers generated as the chatbot’s own contact info, leakage of private training data in generated text, and harms that occur over the course of a conversation. Overall, {LM}-based red teaming is one promising tool (among many needed) for ﬁnding and ﬁxing diverse, undesirable {LM} behaviors before impacting users.},

We investigated whether reconsolidation—the process during which memories become malleable when recalled—can be blocked using a cognitive task and whether such an approach can reduce these unbidden intrusions. We predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources. We showed that intrusive memories were virtually abolished by playing the computer game Tetris following a memoryreactivation task 24 hr after initial exposure to experimental trauma. Furthermore, both memory reactivation and playing Tetris were required to reduce subsequent intrusions (Experiment 2), consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms. A simple, noninvasive cognitive-task procedure administered after emotional memory has already consolidated (i.e., {\textgreater} 24 hours after exposure to experimental trauma) may prevent the recurrence of intrusive memories of those emotional events.},

	abstract = {Advances in artiﬁcial intelligence ({AI}) are enabling systems that augment and collaborate with humans to perform simple, mechanistic tasks like scheduling meetings and grammar-checking text. However, such Human-{AI} collaboration poses challenges for more complex, creative tasks, such as carrying out empathic conversations, due to difﬁculties of {AI} systems in understanding complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks. Here, we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which empathy is critical for success, and examine how {AI} can collaborate with humans to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We develop {HAILEY}, an {AI}-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate {HAILEY} in a non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on {TalkLife} (N=300), a large online peer-topeer support platform. We show that our Human-{AI} collaboration approach leads to a 19.60\% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we ﬁnd a larger 38.88\% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difﬁculty providing support. We systematically analyze the Human-{AI} collaboration patterns and ﬁnd that peer supporters are able to use the {AI} feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on {AI} while reporting improved self-efﬁcacy post-feedback. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, {AI}-in-the-loop writing systems to empower humans in open-ended, social, creative tasks such as empathic conversations.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Social media platforms are increasingly being used to disseminate mental health information online. User-generated content about attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is one of the most popular health topics on the video-sharing social media platform {TikTok}. We sought to investigate the quality of {TikTok} videos about {ADHD}.
Method: The top 100 most popular videos about {ADHD} uploaded by {TikTok} video creators were classiﬁed as misleading, useful, or personal experience. Descriptive and quantitative characteristics of the videos were obtained. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials ({PEMAT}-A/V) and Journal of American Medical Association ({JAMA}) benchmark criteria were used to assess the overall quality, understandability, and actionability of the videos.
Results: Of the 100 videos meeting inclusion criteria, 52\% (n = 52) were classiﬁed as misleading, 27\% (n = 27) as personal experience, and 21\% (n = 21) as useful. Classiﬁcation agreement between clinician ratings was 86\% (kappa statistic of 0.7766). Videos on the platform were highly understandable by viewers but had low actionability. Non-healthcare providers uploaded the majority of misleading videos. Healthcare providers uploaded higher quality and more useful videos, compared to non-healthcare providers.
Conclusions: Approximately half of the analyzed {TikTok} videos about {ADHD} were misleading. Clinicians should be aware of the widespread dissemination of health misinformation on social media platforms and its potential impact on clinical care.},

We conducted a study in the context of content moderation and discovered that individual differences relating to trust in humans, fear of artificial intelligence ({AI}), power usage, and political ideology can predict whether a user will invoke the positive or negative machine heuristic. For example, users who distrust other humans tend to be more positive toward machines.

Although having meaningful work, or work that is significant, facilitates personal growth, and contributes to the greater good, has been linked to better mental health, people’s work might also need to be satisfying or enjoyable to improve outcomes. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to examine meaningful work’s relation to mental health (i.e. depression, anxiety and stress) and investigate job satisfaction as a moderator of this relation.
Methods: The study hypotheses were tested with a large, diverse sample recruited from an online source.
Results: Partially supporting hypotheses, when controlling for job satisfaction, meaningful work negatively correlated with depression but did not have a significant relation with anxiety and stress. Similarly, job satisfaction negatively predicted depression and stress. Furthermore, the relations between meaningful work and both anxiety and stress were moderated by job satisfaction. Specifically, only people perceiving their work as meaningful and satisfying reported less anxiety and stress.
Conclusions: Although continued research is needed, employers and employees may have to target both the meaningfulness and job satisfaction to address the issues of stress and anxiety among working adults.},

To understand how design can help overcome these challenges, we created a visual library of 72 sketched illustrations, informed by the Observations of Daily Living framework along with insights from 11 clinician interviews. We utilized our library with storyboarding techniques, free-form sketching, and interviews, in co-design sessions with 13 pairs of chronically-ill teens and their parents. We found that teens depicted symptoms as being interwoven with narratives of personal and social identity. Teens and parents were enthusiastic about collaboratively-generated, interactive storyboards as a tracking and communication mechanism, and suggested three ways in which they could aid in communication and coordination with informal and formal caregivers. In this paper, we detail these findings, to guide the design of tools for symptom-tracking and incorporation of patient-generated data into pediatric care.},

This conversation has grave implications for communities that often fnd themselves an afterthought in technology design, and who coincidentally could beneft most from technological interventions in response to societal oppression. To explore this topic, we examined futuring through co-designed speculative design fctions as methods to envision utopian and dystopian futures. In a case study, we examined technology's role in the imagined futures of youth participants of a Chicago summer design program. We highlight emerging themes and contribute an analysis of remote co-design through an Afrofuturism lens. Our analysis shows that concepts of utopian futures and technologies to support those futures are still heavily laden with dystopian realities of racism and poverty. We discuss ways that speculative design fctions and futuring can serve to address inclusivity in concept generation for new technologies, and we provide recommendations for conducting design techniques remotely with historically excluded populations.},

Automatic code summarization is a prized target of software engineering research, due to the high value summaries have to programmers and the simultaneously high cost of writing and maintaining documentation by hand. Current work is almost all based on machine models trained via big data input. Large datasets of examples of code and summaries of that code are used to train an e.g. encoder-decoder neural model. Then the output predictions of the model are evaluated against a set of reference summaries. The input is code not seen by the model, and the prediction is compared to a reference. The means by which a prediction is compared to a reference is essentially word overlap, calculated via a metric such as {BLEU} or {ROUGE}. The problem with using word overlap is that not all words in a sentence have the same importance, and many words have synonyms. The result is that calculated similarity may not match the perceived similarity by human readers. In this paper, we conduct an experiment to measure the degree to which various word overlap metrics correlate to human-rated similarity of predicted and reference summaries. We evaluate alternatives based on current work in semantic similarity metrics and propose recommendations for evaluation of source code summarization.},

We conducted a systematic review and thematic analysis of 47 computing research papers discussing participatory research with communities for the development of technological artifacts and systems, published over the last two decades. From this review, we identified seven themes associated with the evolution of a project: from establishing community partnerships to sustaining results. Our findings suggest that several tensions characterize these projects, many of which relate to the power and position of researchers, and the computing research environment, relative to community partners. We discuss the implications of our findings and offer methodological proposals to guide {HCI}, and computing research more broadly, towards practices that center communities.},

In this article, we define {CBPR} principles, differentiate it from a more traditional psychology research approach, retrace its historical roots, provide concrete steps for its implementation, discuss its potential benefits, and explore practical and ethical challenges for its integration into psychology research. Finally, we provide a case study of {CBPR} in psychology to illustrate its key constructs and implementation. In sum, {CBPR} is a relevant, important, and promising research framework that may guide the implementation of more effective, culturally appropriate, socially just, and sustainable community-based psychology research.},

By analyzing popular empathy activities aimed at understanding people with disabilities, we examine the ways empathy works to both powerfully and problematically align designers with the values of people who may use their products. Drawing on disability studies and feminist theorizing, we describe how acts of empathy building may further distance people with disabilities from the processes designers intend to draw them into. We end by reimagining empathy as guided by the lived experiences of people with disabilities who are traditionally positioned as those to be empathized.},

It has immediate relevance in fields ranging from community development to education, health, public engagement, environmental issues and problem solving in the workplace. This new edition has been extensively revised to create a user-friendly textbook on {PAR} theory and practice, including: • updated references and a comprehensive overview of different approaches to {PAR} (pragmatic, psychosocial, critical); • more emphasis on the art of process design, especially in complex social settings characterized by uncertainty and the unknown; • developments in the use of Web2 collaborative tools and digital strategies to support real-time data gathering and processing; • updated examples and stories from around the world, in a wide range of fields; • critical commentaries on major issues in the social sciences, including stakeholder theory, systems thinking, causal analysis, monitoring and evaluation, research ethics, risk assessment and social innovation. This modular textbook provides novel perspectives and ideas in a longstanding tradition that strives to reconnect science and the inquiry process with life in society. It provides coherent and critical treatment of core issues in the ongoing evolution of {PAR}, making it suitable for a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses. It is intended for use by researchers, students and working professionals seeking to improve or rethink their approach to co-creating knowledge and supporting action for the well-being of all.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the literature focused on co-design with communities, studying its applicability in the field of Information and Communication Technologies for Development ({ICTD}). Texts dated from 2002 to 2013 have been surveyed, covering both subjects: "co-design" and "development". Based on their disciplinary orientation, three clusters were identified: (1) information and communication for development, with a focus on developmental goals; (2) information systems, with a concern for technology design; and (3) social design, in which social issues are prioritized. The analysis reverted on the identification and discussion of the themes emphasized in the literature as the most important aspects for linking co-design activities with development. Five themes emerged from the analysis: stakeholders, context, ownership, social learning, and sustainability. The paper defines each theme and shows how it has been approached differently in the three clusters of related literature. This review is meant to inform future co-design studies in community settings, by providing a map of the most important research issues in this field coupled with considerations on how different disciplinary orientations-developmental, information systems, and social sciences-are likely to inform different approaches in dealing with these issues.},

One strategy for anticipating and addressing ethical challenges related to {AI}/{ML} for health care is patient and public involvement in the design of those technologies – often referred to as ‘co-design’. Co-design has a diverse intellectual and practical history, however, and has been conceptualized in many different ways. Moreover, {AI}/{ML} introduces challenges to co-design that are often underappreciated. Informed by perspectives from critical data studies and critical digital health studies, we review the research literature on involvement in health care, and involvement in design, and examine the extent to which co-design as commonly conceptualized is capable of addressing the range of normative issues raised by {AI}/{ML} for health care. We suggest that {AI}/{ML} technologies have amplified and modified existing challenges related to patient and public involvement, and created entirely new challenges. We outline three pitfalls associated with co-design for ethical {AI}/{ML} for health care and conclude with suggestions for addressing these practical and conceptual challenges.},

Recent scholarship in {HCI} and design has analyzed the ways collaborative design engagements, such as {PD} situated in the design workshop can amplify voices and empower underserved populations. Yet, we argue that {PD} as instantiated in the design workshop is very much an affluent and privileged activity that often neglects the challenges associated with envisioning equitable design solutions among underserved populations. Based on two series of community-based {PD} workshops with underserved populations in the U.S., we highlight key areas of tension and considerations for a more equitable {PD} approach: historical context of the research environment, community access, perceptions of materials and activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of personal narratives. By reflecting on these tensions as a call-to-action, we hope to deconstruct the privilege of the {PD} workshop within {HCI} and re-center the focus of design on individuals who are historically underserved.},

To better understand and solidify the importance of the user within the technological artifact, these designers often create 'personas' - prototypical users with names, faces, interests and preferences. Personas serve as boundary objects used as conceptual stand-ins for users when team members make design decisions. This article traces the discursive construction of the 'user' within web design texts and how these texts describe the persona technique. The analysis suggests that the use of personas is motivated as much by political realities within new media organizations, as it is by the desire to address user needs. In addition, it is argued that personas serve to reinscribe the conceptual separation between the user and designer despite technological developments (like Web 2.0) that blur this boundary. © The Author(s) 2010.},

The configuration of digital artifacts and/or processes can provide an illusion of participation but lack supportive processes and affordances to allow meaningful participation to happen. This exploratory paper examines the realm of pseudo-participation in the design of public digital services through two concepts: 1) pseudo-participation by design, digital interfaces, and tools that provide the illusion of participation to the people, 2) pseudo-participation in design, processes in which those affected by the design decisions are marginalized and not given any agency. We contribute to the re-imagination of participatory design in modern societies where the role of politics has become ubiquitous and is yet to be critically scrutinized by designers.},

Our findings show that the hostile innovation ecology manifests as constrained access to resources, an inequitable regulatory framework, diminished agency in the software design process, and limits to the will of our community partners. We discuss the paths toward innovation for United Taxi Workers San Diego as compared with transportation network companies (e.g. Lyft, Uber) in terms of access to funding, regulation, labor, expertise, and market.

In education research, a {PAR} approach typically centers the wisdom and experience of students (or school-age youth) and educators, positioning them as architects of research rather than objects of study. This form of participatory inquiry and collective action serves as a countercurrent in schools, where democratic inquiry and meaning making contradicts the top-down knowledge transmission practices bounded by prescribed curriculum and high-stakes standardized assessments. Like all scholars, those engaged in {PAR} contend with questions regarding standards of scientific practice and what counts as evidence even as they co-generate knowledge and solidarity with communities in which they may be members or allies that are outside the academy.},

Based on evaluation theory, we propose seven key questions through which to characterize evaluations in {PD} and analyze the 17 papers. Our analysis reveals that formal evaluations of {PD}’s aims are rare; generally lack details on methods; are researcher- and not participant-led, and that a corpus of work around evaluations needs to be developed. We suggest more explicit, systematic evaluations of {PD}’s central aims to enhance accountability, learning and knowledge building, and to strengthen {PD} internally and externally.},

It, then, draws upon interviews with researchers who have the experience of collaborative and {PD} projects to identify ethical considerations that they have encountered in their work and uses these to propose a set of ethical principles.
